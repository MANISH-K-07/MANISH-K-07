## Manish Krishna Kandrakota — Software Developer & Open-Source Contributor

### ⭐ Profile Summary :

I am a final-year B.Tech Computer Science Engineering student at Sreenidhi Institute of Science and Technology (India) with a strong interest in software engineering, static analysis, distributed systems, software security, compilers, machine learning systems, program analysis and open-source ecosystems.
My primary technical experience comes from contributing extensively to Checkstyle, a widely used Java static analysis tool, where I have made significant improvements to code reliability, test coverage, and rule implementations. Following which, I have built an extensive set of projects for my portfolio.

I am currently preparing to pursue a Masters in Computer Science at a top global university, with the goal of becoming a systems-focused software engineer capable of building impactful, large-scale developer tools and software systems.

### ✒️ Blogs & Articles :

I actively document my technical work through long-form articles that break down complex systems into first-principles explanations. From compilers and program analysis to distributed systems and machine learning systems, I write in-depth technical blogs that cover design decisions, implementation details, experiments, limitations, and research relevance—treating documentation as an integral part of engineering, not an afterthought. I also write articles that share my personal experiences, mistakes—that make me human, and my learning journey.
